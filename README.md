# calam-cpp
> A CPU-based graphics library where every pixel is pain
***
**Calam** is a lightweight graphics wrapper built on top of SDL2, designed for educational and rapid prototyping purposes. It abstracts away the low-level details of SDL while exposing simple functions to draw basic 2D primitives such as pixels, lines, circles, ellipses, triangles...etc

## 🚀 Features
- Simple API for drawing:
  - `putPixel`
  - `putLine`
  - `putCircle`
  - `putEllipse`
  - `putTriangle`
- 🧹 Minimal dependencies, maximum clarity
- Built with **C++** and **SDL2**
- Encourages use of custom `Canvas` abstraction
- Header-only style with minimal external dependencies

## 🧱 Requirements
- C++ compiler (supports C++11 or later)
- [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/) development libraries

# ✅ TODOs
- [ ] Add filled versions of shapes
- [ ] Add support for input handling
- [ ] Add double buffering / animations
- [ ] Add image export
